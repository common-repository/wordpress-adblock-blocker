== Description ==

** this plugin is no longer being update. Please feel free to adopt me! **

The WordPress AdBlocker Blocker is designed for one purpose, to block visitors to your website who use FireFox AdBlocker. People have the right to run advertisement blocking software if they choose, I'm not opposed to it but I also believe that website owners have the right to block people who block the ads.
